## Project plan
The tasks of my project will be:
* **Patient scheduling**: To do a patient scheduling we need the **name** or the **identification number** of the patient, the **hour**, the **day**, the **doctor's office** will he/she attended (I decide to use numbers) and the **reason** (Example:  headache) and save it in a .txt file.
* **Creating patient records**:  The program can **generate an identification number** save the name, phone number, birth date and genre, put this information in a .txt file, and a .txt file, with this information can make a percentage of how many men and women are registered, and add this to a .txt.
* **Creating a summary of the doctor's appointment** with this information: height (cm or m), mass (kg), temperature you give it in °C then the program convert to °F, respiratory rate (breaths per minute), respiratory rate (breaths per minute), blood pressure (mm Hg), heart rate (beats per minute) and calculate the dody mass index (BMI). What is the disease of the patient, what drugs need to consume at which time and in which frequency.
