## Project plan
The tasks of my project will be:
* **Patient scheduling**: In order to do a patient scheduling we need the **name** or the **identification number** of the patient, the **hour**, the **day**, the **doctor's office **will he/she attended (I decide to use numbers) and the **reason** (Example:  headache) and save it in a .txt file.
* **Creating patient records**:  The program can **generete an identification number** save the name, phone number, birth date and genre, put this information in a txt file, and a txt file, with this information can make a percentage of how many men and women are registered.
