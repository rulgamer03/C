## Project plan
The tasks of my project will be:
* **Patient scheduling**: To do a patient scheduling we need the **name** or the **identification number** of the patient, the **hour**, the **day**, the **doctor's office** will he/she attended (I decide to use numbers) and the **reason** (Example:  headache) and save it in a .txt file.
* **Creating patient records**:  The program can **generate an identification number** save the name, phone number, birth date and genre, put this information in a .txt file, and a .txt file, with this information can make a percentage of how many men and women are registered, and add this to a .txt.
* **Creating a summary of the doctor's appointment** with this information: height (cm), mass (kg), temperature in Â°C, respiratory rate (breaths per minute), blood pressure (mm Hg), heart rate (beats per minute) and calculate the body mass index (BMI). What is the disease of the patient, what drugs need to consume at which time and in what frequency. At the time that you write some information like temperature, the program prints in console if this is a normal temperature or it is a higher temperature, in a file you can write the "normal conditions" in order to change values in a faster and an easier way.
* **Percentage of patient with each disease** At the time that you do a doctor appointment the program asks you if you want to add a disease or more than one diseases on the statistics, if you says yes the program save in a file .txt for example 10 patients of 20 patients registered have X disease, then convert to a percentage 50% in this case.
